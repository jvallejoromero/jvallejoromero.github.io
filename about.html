                <p class="text">My name is Jonathan Vallejo and I grew up in San Jose, CA. I am 19 years old and I developed a passion for learning all about technology-related things when I was young; it has stuck with me ever since. The first programming language I ever got into was Java, this gave me a good understanding of object oriented programming and I have been diving into more languages ever since. As of now I have worked with Java, Python, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="text">These things include improving my knowledge of web development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), improving my knowledge of programming, as well as learning how to work with databases such as MySQL or learning how to work with frameworks. Slowly but surely I am constantly gaining new knowledge that will help me achieve this goal.</p>
